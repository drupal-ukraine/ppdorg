Welcome to ppdorg project.

This project aims to cover community needs about having comparison between users, teams, countries and so on
in terms of who is better and who is more active.

The project itself is a Drupal distribution with a bunch of modules about Queue API that can scan drupal.org and not only it
for gathering statistics.
